		<description><![CDATA[This reads exactly like the beginning of a three year disaster in Dallas ISD. 1. Hire execs @ 130K with limited experience and or ties to TFA , Broad Foundation 2. New admin building so that all central admin can be together. Why change from using an already owned, under utilized facility? 3, Recommend closinng - Consolidating small NEIGHBORHOOD schools. 4. Re- allocate money to develop a Principal training program. I hope the newly Elected Trustees ask questions, demand transperancy, hold Administration accountable and DO THEIR homework. Watch out for the next steps..... Pay for performance i.e. Microsoft Stack Ranking. (Btw- Microsoft no longer uses stack ranking.]]></description>
